                <b>Historical Roots - </b>
                Sacred writings like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata have references to the 
                ancient history of Rishikesh. This is the place, so the tradition goes, where 
                Lord Rama atoned for murdering Ravana. One of Lord Vishnu's names, "Hrishikesha," 
                is where the term "Rishikesh" originates. Lord Vishnu first appeared to the sage 
                Raibhya Rishi beneath a mango tree.
